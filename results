model of your TV, detach the fuse cap holder with a screwdriver. Then, thoroughly inspect the fuse wire. A TV fuse has blown if there is a visible gap between the wires or a visible metallic or black stain within the glass. If you see vertical lines on your television screen, this is a major problem that must not be ignored. Typically, this issue is caused by a loose cable wiring, a loose or broken board, or a damaged screen. This is a regular issue with televisions and an indication that the panel is malfunctioning. Overheating may irreparably harm an LCD television. The most apparent sign of overheating is a television that abruptly shuts off when it can no longer function correctly. In the majority of situations, overheating is easily remedied by repositioning or cleaning. A dark screen may indicate that the television is switched off, but if you hear sound, you know this is not the case. When your TV has a black screen even when it is turned on, it is highly probable that it is an external device and not the TV itself. Panasonic Some users consider Panasonic to be the most durable television brand on the
market. This company has existed for decades. Depending on use and maintenance, the typical lifetime of a television is between 4 and 10 years (about 40,000 to 100,000 hours). Turning off your television is one of the easiest ways to prolong its lifetime. A defect concealed inside the HDMI cable; replace with a new High-Speed HDMI 2.0 cable. Replace the HDMI cable, since it may include a short or another flaw causing the black screen. Unplug the television for five minutes to reset it. Unplugging the television will reset it and resolve any temporary difficulties. If the lighting fails or burns out, the image will seem black. To determine whether your television’s backlight is causing the issue, turn off the lights in the room and ensure that your television is on. Use a flashlight to examine the screen for an image. You may also factory reset your Samsung smart television by pressing the channel up, volume up, channel down, volume down, and source symbols on the front of your Samsung smart television and following the on-screen instructions by pressing the arrow buttons. Aim the remote towards the red standby light, a little red light at the border of the television. In

Does my Samsung television support AirPlay? With AirPlay 2 available on certain Samsung TV models (2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021), you’ll be able to stream programs, movies, and music, as well as cast photos from all your
Apple devices to the TV. Casting is also possible to your Samsung Smart Monitor! Why does my television not appear on AirPlay? The device may not support AirPlay because it is incompatible. To easily determine if AirPlay is installed on your iPhone: Swipe down from the right edge of the Home screen to access the Control Center. If you have an older iPhone model with a Home button, swipe up from below. Can an iPhone AirPlay to a Smart TV? AirPlay enables you to cast music or video wirelessly from your iPhone, iPad, or Mac to an Apple TV or an AirPlay 2-compatible smart TV, so long as your device is connected to the same Wi-Fi as the TV. Videos may be streamed from any Mac, iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch. Restart your gadget and TV, and then attempt to reconnect. Make sure to choose Allow when prompted on the TV. Additionally, you should check for software updates on your devices. If the issue continues, reset the phone or tablet to factory settings. Ensure that both the iPhone and television are connected to the same Wi-Fi network. Verify that Airplay is enabled on your iPhone. Launch the application from which you

do that? Everyone here leaves theirs on the desk when they leave.” Flabbergasted I walked to each workstation and checked, lo and behold at every workstation neatly placed to the left of the keyboard was an RSA key fob! What does this story have to do with PayPal and the extra security measures they are attempting to employ? Everything. Two factor authentication doesn't do you much good if you don't take measures to ensure that the security it can provide you is not easily circumvented by poor security practices. When not in use do not leave it on your desk while you go to the restroom or leave for the day. The following post below also shows that two factor authentication is not fool proof nor a panacea. You still need strong IT controls and policy in place. http://neural-cybernetix.blogspot.com/2006/07/phishers-defeat-2-factor.html On a side note I actually participated in the beta program and actually have one of the PayPal authentication devices. It was inexpensive, very painless to setup and works well. I keep it with me most of the time and when I don't I make certain that it is stored securely. http://www.darkreading.com/blog.asp?blog_sectionid=415 This is to be expected. I am not a
Apple basher per say (Hey! I have an iPod nano that I love) but it is a matter of exposure to threats. Now that the source code for Safari has been exposed to a greater number of threats there will be more people poking and prodding at it and more vulnerabilities will be found. This is to be expected regardless of the platform or application. In a semi-related blog post over at Taosecurity that I read yesterday it was put very well. http://taosecurity.blogspot.com/2007/06/triple-boot-thinkpad-x60s.html Richard Bejtlich says: “Second, I am attending Black Hat this summer, and I don't trust Windows or Linux to that crowd. Sure, FreeBSD is "just as vulnerable" but the majority of the attackers will be looking for Windows and Linux users. Booting into FreeBSD and staying there will reduce my exposure surface.” I totally agree with this statement. Even with the risk of sounding like a broken record I will reiterate that regardless of platform or application there are vulnerabilities that can . I too will be attending Black Hat and Defcon and will take extra measures from an OS and application perspective to maintain as small an exposure surface as possible. Definitely a day to remember.

Introduced in 2009, Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency and remains the most widely used. Other forms have grown tremendously in popularity since then, including Litecoin, Ethereum, and Ripple. While cryptocurrency exchanges have experienced booms and busts in the
market, experts predict the use of cryptocurrency will continue to increase, making it imperative that CPAs are prepared to understand and educate their clients on the tax implications of these virtual transactions. Special tax rules require taxpayers to treat gains on certain virtual currency positions as taxable even though they still hold their positions. These rules apply to futures and options that qualify as section 1256 contracts, which is potentially relevant to taxpayers buying, selling, and holding Bitcoin futures and options, as well as Ether futures and other virtual currencies.

This comprehensive overview will provide insights into how Dr Dre net worth has evolved from a pioneering rapper to a multi-billionaire mogul, offering a deep dive into the elements that have shaped his financial success. Dr. Dre, born Andre Young, began his music career in the mid-1980s as a World Class Wreckin’ Cru member. However, his work with N.W.A. in the late 1980s cemented his status as a revolutionary figure in hip-hop. The release of “Straight Outta Compton” in 1988 was a defining moment for Dre and the genre, introducing a raw, unapologetic sound that resonated with a broad audience. The success of N.W.A. and subsequent solo projects, including his seminal album “The Chronic,” significantly contributed to Dr. Dre’s early net worth. Dr. Dre’s solo career continued to soar with the release of albums like “2001” and “Compton.” Each of these albums received critical acclaim and performed exceptionally well commercially. “2001” was a landmark release, solidifying Dre’s reputation as a master producer and a leading figure in the music industry. The sales from these albums, combined with lucrative contracts and royalties, have significantly bolstered Dr. Dre’s net worth over the years. In the digital age, streaming has become a significant
revenue stream for artists. Dr. Dre’s music, including his classic albums and collaborations, continues to attract millions of streams on platforms like Spotify and Apple Music. The royalties from these streams contribute substantially to his net worth. As of 2024, streaming revenue remains a significant part of Dr. Dre’s financial portfolio. One of Dr. Dre’s most impactful business ventures is Beats by Dre. Launched in 2008 in collaboration with Jimmy Iovine, the headphone brand revolutionized the audio industry with its high-quality sound and stylish design. Beats by Dre’s success culminated in a major acquisition by Apple Inc. in 2014 for $3 billion. This deal elevated Dr. Dre’s net worth and solidified his position as a savvy entrepreneur. Dr. Dre’s business acumen extends beyond Beats. He has made strategic investments in various sectors, including technology and fashion. His investment in the streaming service Tidal, alongside Jay-Z, highlights his interest in expanding his influence in the music industry. Additionally, Dre’s ventures into the cannabis industry have proven profitable, reflecting a trend among celebrities investing in the booming market. Dr. Dre’s real estate investments further enhance his net worth. He owns several properties, including a stunning mansion in Brentwood, Los Angeles, and various other

Donate SaltSwitch, a new feature of the popular healthy shopping app, FoodSwitch, launches today to empower Aussie shoppers to select the lowest salt options and improve their chances of living a longer life. SaltSwitch was developed by Bupa and The George Institute for Global Health to step up the fight against Australians' top causes of premature deaths – high blood pressure, stroke and heart disease. Salt is a major contributor to high blood pressure, the leading cause of death and disability worldwide – responsible for 9.5 million deaths annually. Australians are eating more than double the daily recommended level of salt. Reducing salt intake by an average of 3 grams a day could reduce the number of deaths from stroke by a
quarter and the number of deaths from coronary heart disease by one fifth. Professor Bruce Neal from The George Institute and The University of Sydney said that many people simply don't realise how much salt they're consuming. "Salt is a silent killer, and its impacts on your health are too often underestimated," he said. "It's really important that people understand a high salt diet is a key driver of high blood pressure, which in turn is a major risk factor for stroke, heart attack and kidney failure. "And more than three quarters of our salt intake comes from processed and restaurant food, so simply removing the salt shaker from the dinner table won't solve the problem. "Importantly, this app can empower people to make informed choices that will make a real difference to their health in the long-term." Bupa's Head of Clinical Advisory, Dr Stan Goldstein said that it is important to help people make decisions in the supermarket aisle that can literally save or cost lives. "Offering a simple, free tool shoppers can have handy on their phones has the potential to make a big difference to purchasing habits. "While we should all try and lower our salt intake, this

"Offering a simple, free tool shoppers can have handy on their phones has the potential to make a big difference to purchasing habits. "While we should all try and lower our salt intake, this app will be particularly beneficial for people diagnosed with high blood pressure who are trying to follow doctors' orders to eat a low salt diet." While doctors and professionals have been enthusiastic about the original FoodSwitch app, they have also highlighted the need for tools to help people with specific health needs, such as those with high blood pressure or heart attack and stroke survivors. National Stroke Foundation Chief Executive Erin Lalor said high blood pressure was the single biggest modifiable risk factor for stroke and reducing salt intake was one way people could keep their blood pressure in the healthy range. "SaltSwitch is an easy way to check the salt content of the food you are buying and we hope it will encourage people using it to choose an alternative product with a lower salt content," Dr Lalor said. You can download FoodSwitch from the
Apple iTunes1 Store or Google Play Store2.

hating the new layout and Spotify needs to listen. This UI makes me miss Napster. Basically this is the mobile view replacing the beloved desktop view. It means less maintenance for them so I understand why they did it but I totally hate it as user. I hate it on mobile. I hate it on desktop. Just basically unusable if you have hundreds (thousands) of artists/albums you like in many genres and decades. I suppose it's fine if you listen to a handful of artists like many people do. My requirements are pretty simple actually, I need an organised library. Organised the way I want. When I open my library I want to see this organisation. Here everything is at the same place: podcasts, albums, artists, folders, etc. and this is not how I like to see it. Desktop was the last "acceptable" interface. But now it's gone. I came to the conclusion Spotify is optimising experience for the casual users which is likely to be the vast majority of their users. Us, "hardcore" users, early adopters, listening to hundreds of artists, albums or countless genres, they don't care about us anymore. They counted on us to convince the mass
market to go all-in digital, we did the work, explaining to the non-tech friend how to use it but now they have mass adoption, we're the "odd" ones, the last line in statistics, they don't do anything for us anymore. I don't blame them, Apple did the same in the early 2010s and share value went up. I used to believe Spotify was different but they are not. This probably means we have to hop off the mainstream bus and find a company who respect their "heavy" / early users. If a new streaming company tailored for heavy music listeners comes out, I'm all-in right away. And all-out Spotify. And this feels ridiculous while fixing the problem is only 2 features away: - Add a permanent "folder" filter option, with the option to move the filter bar away (in settings for eg.) - Option to add anything to a folder: artists, albums, podcast, etc. +1 for New Layout Sucks yeah it look absolutely horrible. complicated ui, ugly design with rounded album cover corners. just why?

round corners for some reason Yes, please change this new overlay, I cant even look at it, it so horrible. I dont need to look all the time at album covers or my playlists covers. Also why is everything round, and on the bottom why its a different color than the rest? I just want the old one back, or just redo or something, idk, go back to the old one option. Designer was crying when doing that This horrible!! I'm a music supervisor and this whole new setup totally sucks and is so difficult to navigate btw all my playlists. Give us a choice to go back to the old setup. Also, folder takes 5 sec to open. what's going on with that?? I like how now, when you click on "Your Library", you get the side panel expanded instead of... viewing your library. Brilliant UX choice, team. Perfect. No notes. But seriously guys, this new update makes navigation a massive chore. Agreed. It's a terrible interface. The new "upgrade" is dreadful!!! not using the right panel for expanding library items is just horrible. It almost makes browsing your library unusable. I utterly hate it. Back to Tidal or
Apple Music for me.The only conclusion I can come to is that Spotify is deliberately trying to take focus away from the user library. I really hope they'll listen to our complaints and change it back.. Or at the very least, let us choose what interface we want to use ! It's crazy that these big company keep changing things that work and that are liked. Whether you like the look of the new interface is purely subjective but let's be honest, it is objectively bad from a practical point of view. It feels like everything's just packed, library is now pure trash.. Like why do I have to click the little arrow when I could just click the whole folder to expand and see all my playlists ? What's the point of that ? It's stupid, it's a bad design implementation and it's annoying. I use Spotify only to listen to my own custom playlist that I have arranged by artist / name / style / country in many many folders, and now having to click on a little icon to expand the folder is the most trashiest thing they could have done to this app. Please revert this, i'm

Christina’s love for music and great food are now combined to create an unforgettable evening that will stir all your senses. Guitarist/Sous Chef A graduate of the Royal Academy of Music in London, Yale University, and the Eastman School of Music, Lars holds a doctoral degree in performance and literature. In addition, Lars has performed several times in guitar master classes conducted by John Williams, David Russell and Manuel Barruecco. Lars was the first guitarist to play and coach chamber music (during five consecutive concert seasons) at the
Apple Hill Summer School, where he taught and performed with members of the London Symphony, New York Philharmonic, Chicago and Boston Symphony Orchestras. Lars directs the classical guitar program at Brooklyn College at the City University of New York, and he also directs the theory and ear training program at Nyack College in Manhattan. Lars’ culinary interests originally relate to the home cooking of his father and older brother. His desire to learn knife sharpening stems from childhood, watching his cabinet maker dad sharpening his wood working tools. The skill of maintaining and using a tool is essential to both wood working as well as cooking, and is indeed similar to the way in which an instrumentalist relates to the tool of his trade. by Christina Lamberti | Oct 28, 2019 | Foodie, Italian Food, Lasagna, Lasagna Bolognese, Risotto I have finally done it!!

This application remediates the website’s HTML, adapts Its functionality and behavior for screen-readers used by the blind users, and for keyboard functions used by individuals with motor impairments. If you’ve found a malfunction or have ideas for improvement, we’ll be happy to hear from you. You can reach out to the website’s operators by using the following email Our website implements the ARIA attributes (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) technique, alongside various different behavioral changes, to ensure blind users visiting with screen-readers are able to read, comprehend, and enjoy the website’s functions. As soon as a user with a screen-reader enters your site, they immediately receive a prompt to enter the Screen-Reader Profile so they can browse and operate your site effectively. Here’s how our website covers some of the most important screen-reader requirements, alongside console screenshots of code examples: Screen-reader optimization: we run a background process that learns the website’s components from top to bottom, to ensure ongoing compliance even when updating the website. In this process, we provide screen-readers with meaningful data using the ARIA set of attributes. For example, we provide accurate form labels; descriptions for actionable icons (social media icons, search icons, cart icons, etc.); validation
guidance for form inputs; element roles such as buttons, menus, modal dialogues (popups), and others. Additionally, the background process scans all of the website’s images and provides an accurate and meaningful image-object-recognition-based description as an ALT (alternate text) tag for images that are not described. It will also extract texts that are embedded within the image, using an OCR (optical character recognition) technology. To turn on screen-reader adjustments at any time, users need only to press the Alt+1 keyboard combination. Screen-reader users also get automatic announcements to turn the Screen-reader mode on as soon as they enter the website. These adjustments are compatible with all popular screen readers, including JAWS and NVDA. Keyboard navigation optimization: The background process also adjusts the website’s HTML, and adds various behaviors using JavaScript code to make the website operable by the keyboard. This includes the ability to navigate the website using the Tab and Shift+Tab keys, operate dropdowns with the arrow keys, close them with Esc, trigger buttons and links using the Enter key, navigate between radio and checkbox elements using the arrow keys, and fill them in with the Spacebar or Enter key.Additionally, keyboard users will find quick-navigation and content-skip menus, available at any

This includes the ability to navigate the website using the Tab and Shift+Tab keys, operate dropdowns with the arrow keys, close them with Esc, trigger buttons and links using the Enter key, navigate between radio and checkbox elements using the arrow keys, and fill them in with the Spacebar or Enter key.Additionally, keyboard users will find quick-navigation and content-skip menus, available at any time by clicking Alt+1, or as the first elements of the site while navigating with the keyboard. The background process also handles triggered popups by moving the keyboard focus towards them as soon as they appear, and not allow the focus drift outside of it. Users can also use shortcuts such as “M” (menus), “H” (headings), “F” (forms), “B” (buttons), and “G” (graphics) to jump to specific elements. We aim to support the widest array of browsers and assistive technologies as possible, so our users can choose the best fitting tools for them, with as few limitations as possible. Therefore, we have worked very hard to be able to support all major systems that comprise over 95% of the user market share including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox,
Apple Safari, Opera and Microsoft Edge, JAWS and NVDA (screen readers), both for Windows and for MAC users. Despite our very best efforts to allow anybody to adjust the website to their needs, there may still be pages or sections that are not fully accessible, are in the process of becoming accessible, or are lacking an adequate technological solution to make them accessible. Still, we are continually improving our accessibility, adding, updating and improving its options and features, and developing and adopting new technologies. All this is meant to reach the optimal level of accessibility, following technological advancements. For any assistance, please reach out to WhatsApp

In der nächsten Woche bringen fast alle großen Tech-Giganten aus dem Nasdaq Zahlen – können diese Zahleen die hohen Bewertungen dann rechtfertigen? Gestern stürzte Chip-Hersteller Intel nach Vorlage der Zahlen ab (aufgrund einer sehr schwachen Prognose) – in ähnlicher Dimension wie zuvor Tesla. Im Grunde sind die Zahlen aller Chip-Hersteller eher mau, nur Nvidia scheint da eine Ausnahme zu sein.

of considerable size and influence tend to be in northern England or the English Midlands. There are fifty settlements which have been designated city status in England, while the wider United Kingdom has sixty-six. While many cities in England are quite large in size, such as Birmingham, Sheffield, Manchester, Liverpool, Leeds, Newcastle, Bradford, Nottingham and others, a large population is not necessarily a prerequisite for a settlement to be afforded city status. Traditionally the status was afforded to towns with diocesan cathedrals and so there are smaller cities like Wells, Ely, Ripon, Truro and Chichester. According to the Office for National Statistics the ten largest, continuous built-up urban areas are: England's economy is one of the largest in the world, with an average GDP per capita of £22,907. Usually regarded as a mixed market economy, it has adopted many free market principles, yet maintains an advanced social welfare infrastructure. The official currency in England is the pound sterling, whose ISO 4217 code is GBP. Taxation in England is quite competitive when compared to much of the rest of Europe—as of 2009 the basic rate of personal tax is 20% on taxable income up to £37,400, and 40% on any additional
earnings above that amount. The economy of England is the largest part of the UK's economy, which has the 18th highest GDP PPP per capita in the world. England is a leader in the chemical and pharmaceutical sectors and in key technical industries, particularly aerospace, the arms industry, and the manufacturing side of the software industry. London, home to the London Stock Exchange, the United Kingdom's main stock exchange and the largest in Europe, is England's financial centre—100 of Europe's 500 largest corporations are based in London. London is the largest financial centre in Europe, and as of 2009 is also the largest in the world. The Bank of England, founded in 1694 by Scottish banker William Paterson, is the United Kingdom's central bank. Originally established as private banker to the Government of England, since 1946 it has been a state-owned institution. The Bank has a monopoly on the issue of banknotes in England and Wales, although not in other parts of the United Kingdom. The government has devolved responsibility to the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee for managing the monetary policy of the country and setting interest rates.

a decline began during the Industrial Revolution with the move away from the land and increasing urbanisation of the populace. The cuisine of England has, however, recently undergone a revival, which has been recognised by the food critics with some good ratings in Restaurant's best restaurant in the world charts. An early book of English recipes is the Forme of Cury from the royal court of Richard II. Traditional examples of English food include the Sunday roast, featuring a roasted joint (usually beef, lamb, chicken or pork) served with assorted vegetables, Yorkshire pudding, stuffing and gravy. Other prominent meals include fish and chips and the full English breakfast (generally consisting of bacon, sausages, grilled tomatoes, fried bread, black pudding, baked beans, mushrooms, and eggs). Various meat pies are consumed such as steak and kidney pie, steak and ale pie, cottage pie, pork pie (usually eaten cold) and the Cornish Pasty. Sausages are commonly eaten, either as bangers and mash or toad in the hole. Lancashire hotpot is a well known stew. Some of the most popular cheeses are Cheddar and Wensleydale. Many Anglo-Indian hybrid dishes, curries, have been created such as chicken tikka masala and balti. Sweet English dishes include
apple pie, mince pies, spotted dick, scones, Eccles cakes, custard and sticky toffee pudding. Common drinks include tea, whose popularity was increased by Catherine of Braganza, whilst frequently consumed alcoholic drinks include wines, ciders and English beers, such as bitter, mild, stout, and brown ale. The earliest known examples are the prehistoric rock and cave art pieces, most prominent in North Yorkshire, Northumberland and Cumbria, but also feature further south, for example at Creswell Crags. With the arrival of Roman culture in the 1st century, various forms of art utilising statues, busts, glasswork and mosaics were the norm. There are numerous surviving artefacts, such as those at Lullingstone and Aldborough. During the Early Middle Ages the style was sculpted crosses and ivories, manuscript painting, gold and enamel jewellery, demonstrating a love of intricate, interwoven designs such as in the Staffordshire Hoard discovered in 2009. Some of these blended Gaelic and Anglian styles, such as the Lindisfarne Gospels and Vespasian Psalter.

Our Discord Server: https://discord.gg/PazjBDkTmW Chapter 99: The Final Church in the Shadows of Palgauro City "Lord Lolth, long time no see." Shelldor didn’t immediately tell Lolth what happened, but from her tired expression, it was clear that the usually cheerful Red Dragon Grand Monarch had recently encountered some troubling issues. The Happy Number carriage stopped outside Palgauro City. Shelldor led a few people through different areas of Palgauro City, from poverty to luxury. While things seemed unchanged at first glance, there were subtle differences upon closer inspection. Even in the bustling center, the arrogant nobles were nowhere to be seen. And in the slums, there were fewer poorly dressed beggars and vagrants. The streets were much cleaner, and the city’s rivers were no longer filled with garbage. Signs were posted everywhere saying "a fine of five silver coins for public urination" and "no littering, trash must be put in bins." Overall, Shelldor successfully implemented the demon king’s ideas without any strange deviations. Under her
guidance, the group quickly arrived at the iconic building of Palgauro City. The magnificent Lauren Institute, supported by twelve white stone pillars nearly ten meters tall and constructed entirely of giant stones! Although smaller than some ancient palaces or churches, the Institute still covered an area larger than four or five football fields. Even though it has a history of only a little over a hundred years, this place still carries a dignified and majestic atmosphere. "I consider this place my new nest… Hmm, all built with giant stones, feels quite comfortable to live in." Saying this, Shelldor easily pushed open the heavy door of the council chamber, revealing the unchanged interior. Like a theater, the stepped seating surrounded on three sides, with a tall dome illuminated by magic crystals above, and a long aisle leading to the widest platform at the center of the building. Originally meant for important foreign guests and the highest senators of the Republic of Seychelles, the platform now lay empty, covered with woven mats to serve as Shelldor’s bed. "Feel free to sit in the front row." Shelldor said, sitting on the platform. LOLth and her group took a seat on the nearest step directly

"Alright, Shelldor, say a few less words," Lolth remained calm, sitting cross-legged with her hands folded in front of her chest, "What exactly happened here?" Sometimes troubles can’t be avoided, Lolth believed that dealing with problems early would make things easier. "Indeed, nothing escapes the notice of Lord Lolth, have you already spotted the issues in Palgauro City right after arriving here?" Shelldor said this and Lolth shook her head. "No, I didn’t notice anything wrong with Palgauro City," Lolth said as she looked at Shelldor, whose dragon scales looked dull, "I sensed it from you… if even you, the Red Dragon Grand Monarch, can’t rest well, then it must be a serious situation." "Is that so? Using wax doesn’t seem reliable," Shelldor said as she changed from lying down to sitting on a high platform, sighing, "However, it’s indeed a rather troubling matter." Saying this, she used her front paws to retrieve a black item from between the scales on her chest and tossed it towards Lolth. "What is this?" Lolth took the black item, a rolled-up scroll, surprisingly light to hold despite being as big as half of one of Shelldor’s scales, weighing almost the same as an
apple. "This is an activated scroll." Shelldor answered with a surprising response for Lolth. "Scroll?" She took another careful look at it, although the black object felt very light and seemed to be made of a thin layer of something rolled together, its shape was completely fixed and very hard. Rather than resembling a scroll, it looked more like a piece of modern art. Feeling the residual magic essence on top of it left Lolth feeling quite puzzled. This kind of magic essence made her feel very strange. Instead of being formed by the magic power left from a magic scroll, it seemed more like… something that would only have magic essence after experiencing chaos like elemental tides. However, it did not possess any specific attributes. "Where did you get this thing from?" Lolth couldn’t help but ask. "My demon dragon underlings got it from a bunch of shady swindlers in the city," Shelldor paused, then corrected himself, "No, they’re not swindlers… They’re a group of reclusive, self-proclaimed ‘The Final Church’ followers, believing in an ancient deity I’ve never heard of before – initially I did think they were swindlers, but now it seems like they’re playing for real…" You must

I’m so glad to hear that your granddaughter wants wedding pie! Which of our pie shops is nearest you (or where the wedding will be held)? The cost varies slightly by shop. I would be happy to have the nearest shop get in touch with you if you’d like. We do not offer jar pies, but it sounds like a neat idea. 🙂 My daughter is getting married in Leland on June 11th and is interested in having pie vs cake. Can you give us pricing for the big pie and for small tarts for 100 guests from your Traverse City location?

periods of economic volatility, technological innovation continues to drive productivity and create new markets. Tech companies have become synonymous with explosive growth potential. With the constant advancement of artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and the Internet of Things (IoT), tech firms are positioned to capitalize on future trends that could redefine the way we live and work. Additionally, the digital transformation accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic has reinforced the importance of technology in all aspects of business and personal life, further boosting the prominence of tech companies in investment portfolios. Understanding the Risks Despite the promising opportunity, investing in tech requires a keen awareness of its inherent risks. The rapid pace of innovation means that today’s tech giant can quickly become tomorrow’s laggard if it fails to adapt. Furthermore, regulatory challenges, particularly around data privacy and antitrust concerns, can impact tech companies’ operations and market valuations. High valuations also pose a risk. While many tech firms justify their high price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios with robust growth prospects, some might struggle to live up to their market valuations, potentially leading to sharp corrections. Investors should remain cautious of hype-driven investments, often found among startups or firms valued on projected growth rather than proven
earnings. Strategies for Investing in Tech Diversification: Spread investments across a mix of established and emerging tech companies. While giants like Apple and Microsoft provide relative stability, emerging players might offer significant upside. Research and Due Diligence: Stay informed about the technological landscape and individual company performance. Understanding the business models, competitive advantages, and market positioning of tech firms can help mitigate risks. Long-Term Perspective: Given the volatility inherent in tech stocks, adopting a long-term investment strategy can help weather short-term fluctuations and benefit from sustained growth in a company’s intrinsic value. Thematic Investing: Focus on particular technological trends such as artificial intelligence, renewable technology, or cybersecurity. This strategy allows investors to target specific growth areas within the broader tech landscape. Conclusion Investing in tech companies offers a pathway to participate in the unfolding technological transformation sweeping across the globe. While the prospects are bright, navigating this dynamic sector requires careful analysis, patience, and a balanced approach. By understanding the landscape and managing risks effectively, investors can position themselves to capture the potential rewards of the digital age.

WRITERS Writers being on strike means the release of series and movies will slow down. The most immediately affected shows are late-night and talk shows. We’re approaching summer when writers would start working on fall series, so those will see delays. Shows currently filming can only continue to do so if they had completed work in hand before the strike, and specific rules apply to any writer-producers or writer-directors on set in regard to making changes to those scripts. While shows nearing the end of their seasons may wrap up on time, the future of additional seasons will be uncertain. For example, the 2007-2008 WGA strike delayed several series or led to shortened seasons. Productions halted work. Some series were canceled. The consequences will add up, even if reality TV sees a brief boost. It isn’t only about writers either. Some Teamsters are supporting the WGA’s strike and won’t cross picket lines. The easiest way to help those on strike is to support the writers who create the content you love. The WGA represents over 11,000 members who write for movies, television, news, and online media. Boost their voices on social media, share your support with notes, and follow their
guidance. The WGA has a social media toolkit you can use you show solidarity. If you are able to join a picket line, do so. The WGA has a picket schedule on their site. Solidarity with writers is the key. We will continue to update this post with relevant news. v2.08 – © Nerdist All Rights Reserved Hey reader!

The Writers Guild of America (WGA) moved forward with a strike on Tuesday morning after studios rejected the organization’s proposals for better compensation and equity for writers. A record percentage of guild members—97.85%—voted to authorize the strike. This is the group’s first strike since 2007, which lasted for 100 days. Nerdist covers a breadth of pop culture across film and television, none of which would exist without writers creating the stories we love. Here’s what you should know about the WGA strike. The WGA negotiating committee has been talking to the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) for the last six weeks. AMPTP negotiated on behalf of Netflix, Amazon,
Apple, Disney, Discovery-Warner, NBC Universal, Paramount, and Sony. Streaming and the profound effect it has had upon writer compensation and residuals is at the heart of the negotiations. In short, business practices from studios that have put streaming at the forefront have changed entertainment. That should trickle down to affect all aspects of the business, especially updating compensation and residual models. However, the payment structure for writers is set up as though entertainment has not drastically shifted. The prevalence of streaming cuts into a writer’s work airing and re-airing on broadcast TV and therefore cuts into residuals. The WGA negotiated for members across all sectors for a fair deal that gives the writers compensation beyond that of a “a gig economy inside a union workforce.” Streaming entertainment is not the only issue, though. The below details what the WGA is asking for: COMPENSATION AND RESIDUALS PENSION PLAN AND HEALTH FUND PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS AND PROTECTION IN THE EMPLOYMENT OF WRITERS Writers being on strike means the release of series and movies will slow down.

Additionally, the background process scans all of the website’s images and provides an accurate and meaningful image-object-recognition-based description as an ALT (alternate text) tag for images that are not described.

sounds like a setup for some sort of year-in-review post, but it's not. We're just sort of rambling here, to be honest, and we're not sure how to make a clean segue to the topic of this entry. So, let's just go without one. Microsoft and Red Hat roamed further into the cloud this week. Redmond trotted out some test builds of Azure cloud add-ons, as Redmond magazine Mary Jo Foley so ably explains. Red Hat, the open source vendor (that always sounds like a strange description...), made its play for a cloud-based Platform-as-a-Service by buying Makara. Jeff Schwartz offers further detail and technical what-not on RCPmag.com. Not really earth-shattering news, is it? Well, the Earth is likely to stay well intact at least until January at this point, at least on the tech-news front. That'll mean shorter RCPUs with less pontification over the next couple of weeks. You're welcome. Posted by Lee Pender on December 02, 20100 comments Share SAP is a company so important and presumably so difficult to manage that it actually has two CEOs. In any case, one of them this week delivered the good news that IT spending is coming around, particularly in the software
market. No word yet on what the other CEO thinks. Posted on December 02, 20100 comments Share Really, now, why? Why are these tablet things so popular? What's really weird here is that a bunch of investment bankers are going to be carrying around products with the super-cool Apple logo on them. What will that do to Apple's street cred with the bookish hipster coffee-house set?

RCPU... Also, other than this entry, RCPU is going to be pretty short the next couple of days. So enjoy that while it lasts. Thanks, Lee Posted by Lee Pender on September 15, 20100 comments Share This is the release that's meant to be a Salesforce.com killer. Wonder what Marc Benioff (Salesforce.com's CEO, of course) will have to say about that... Posted by Lee Pender on September 15, 20100 comments Share Apparently yesterday's patches were not quite good enough. Four zero-day bugs from the infamous Stuxnet worm seem to have gone un-patched. Posted by Lee Pender on September 15, 20100 comments Share Is the recession over? Does it feel over? It doesn't really matter all that much what the stock market is doing or what leading economic indicators say as long as the job market is still lousy. Fortunately, though, a group called TechAmerica says that tech jobs actually picked up a bit in the first half of 2010... by 0.5 percent. But hey, a bump is a bump. Considering that the year-over-year numbers from TechAmerica, which sounds like the name of a nerdy 1970s singing group (remember Up with People?), show a gain in hiring in 2010 versus a
loss of jobs in 2009, things are looking better. But they're not looking that much better. Dig this quote from Chris Paoli's rcpmag.com story on this whole deal: "'Though the tech industry was among the last to feel the effects of the economic downturn of 2008-2009, it was not immune to job loss and is only slowly showing signs of climbing out of it,' said Josh James, vice president for research and industry analysis at TechAmerica Foundation, in a press release. 'Tech employment as of June 2010 stood at 5.78 million, compared to 5.99 million in January 2009. So there is still a way to go before we've made up for lost jobs, and continued recovery is by no means certain.'" Way to be a floater in the punch bowl there, Josh. Seriously, would it kill somebody to deliver good news without dropping in a heavy dose of caveats? Oh, well, a little good news is better than more bad news we suppose. And for about 30,000 people in the tech industry (according to TechAmerica), the recession "ended" in the first half of 2010. We like hearing that. How worried are you about your job? If you're not working, how tough

Advanced Search Interesting little piece here in Fast Company about how logos can serve almost as religious symbols to folks who aren't religious already. Do you figure anybody has the same loyalty to the Windows logo as adherents of the Church of
Apple have to their fruity symbol? We're thinking probably not... Posted by Lee Pender on October 04, 20101 comments Share It's one of those head-slapping moments. Some guru from Goldman Sachs comes out and makes a bunch of suggestions about how Microsoft should run its business, and we at RCPU sit here and slap our heads saying, "Why didn't we think of that?" Except we did...and we weren't the only ones. Goldman downgraded Microsoft's stock at some point over the weekend, and, in doing so, a Goldman analyst went off on a rant about what Microsoft needs to do to get itself out of the decade-long stock-price slump it's in. As Todd Bishop's always excellent blog reports, Goldman had three suggestions for Redmond. And we quote, from the Goldman report as quoted on Bishop's blog: "(1) A materially increased dividend beyond the recent 23% increase, moving Microsoft into the top 20 dividend-paying companies in the S&P 500 in terms of dividend yield. We believe this would open the door to a larger investor base and keep the company more diligent from a spending perspective. (2) A coherent consumer strategy that could involve paring back investments and/or divesting more peripheral assets such

ask it for. Google is including a few prompts for you to try or customize to get you started. The last update is that the Magic Editor in Google Photos is coming to laptops exclusively as a feature for Chromebook Plus devices. First available on Google’s Pixel devices, Magic Editor was part of the Google One subscription plan for a while, but now it’s more broadly available provided your phone meets the minimum specs. As for laptops, though, Chromebook Plus models are the only ones that can use Magic Editor. The reasoning seems pretty simple: Chromebooks can run Android apps, including Google Photos. Still, if you’ve wanted to mess around with Magic Editor on a bigger screen than your phone, doing so on a Chromebook seems like a decent option. As a refresher, Magic Editor basically lets you manipulate your photos in a variety of ways to change the reality of what you captured, but much faster and easier than using something like Photoshop. You can select people or objects to move them around, have the app turn a cloudy sky blue, resize or delete other objects and generally make it even harder to trust that photos you create or
share are authentic. Unsurprisingly, Google is also baking its Gemini chatbot more directly into Chromebooks by having the app pre-installed and sitting right on the launcher. More significant though is that Google is giving Chromebook Plus buyers a full year of its Google One AI Premium plan, which puts Gemini features right in Gmail, Docs and other Workplace apps. It also includes access to Gemini Advanced, which adds support for things like uploading documents for analysis and access to Gemini Pro 1.5 and its 1 million token context window (which Google said would grow to 2 million tokens soon). Given that the Google One AI plan costs $20 a month, double the standard pricing for the 2TB storage plan, this is a pretty good perk for Chromebook Plus buyers, even if they don’t care about using Gemini. And it sounds like even if you already subscribe to another Google One plan, you'll be able to get the year of Google One's AI option. There are also a number of new software tweaks coming to all Chromebooks too. Probably most notable is Game Dashboard, a sort of control center for gaming-related activities. While most Chromebooks still can’t run a lot of games,

Age, sales efficiency increasingly depends on the service value to users. Thanks to the network effect, positive reviews become the best advertising. Therefore, the most successful companies of our time have already switched their focus from sales to service. They support their products and their culture through metrics, values ​​and learning. For example, traditional banks use their homepage on the internet to promote all services, turning it into an advertising platform. This causes the user to drown in a large number of offers and lose direction. Fintech companies, in an easy and accessible way, suggest starting with key scenarios, for example, opening an account and only then gradually making a contextual upsell. User experience and emotions are more important to them. Unfortunately, some specialists believe that a knowledge of psychology is a good tool to increase conversion. But, instead of using human psychology to trick users into buying useless products, we should think about how human psychology can increase the value of our products and help to deliver an experience customers will appreciate. Self-Assessment: Where would you place your business approach, culture and goals on this scale? “1” on the scale is a selfish company that is driven only by
profit and selling, looking at people as numbers behind conversion. A score of “10” is a company focused on customer needs, feelings and behavior, and the main aim is to provide real value by changing people’s lives and world for the better. What is the main driver of your activity — to sell or to serve? How could your bank or credit union move closer to a “10”? What are the key actions that can take you closer to the “serve” principle? You might wonder, what’s the problem with information? Isn’t it a good practice to explain everything to your user? From a marketing perspective, it is. In the previous age, people read the description of products in magazines to find out how it could help them. Basically, advertising was about simple information about products. Even today, you can see a lot of attempts to promote products just by informing customers about product features. Unfortunately, that approach does not work well for digital products. Today, we have too much information around us and too many competitive solutions. Thankfully, only 20% of our brains think rationally. We perceive and act through emotions and instincts – so-called “subconsciousness.” This protects us from information

customer, understand his needs and expectations, in order to deliver the best possible experience. Self Assessment: Ask yourself, where would you place your institution’s business approach, culture and goals on this scale? What is the main drive of your activity — to inform or to create an emotional connection? “Information” is about providing some facts about your product or service, like the do-it-yourself approach. If a potential user really needs your solution, then they will search for it as long as it’s needed by carefully reading all the information on your website. “1” on the scale is about a company that absolutely has no idea how the user feels and does not let them get too close. “Emotions” means to focus on the feeling that our product or service creates. Such a company is interested in understanding its users well, their thoughts, emotions and behaviors. Why do they need your product, how will they use it and how can you better help them? What could be a pleasant experience in our case? “10” on a scale could be given to a company that tries to perceive the world through its customer eyes and creates a close connection through its service.
Apple is a good example of such approach. If you wish to improve your result and get closer to a “10,” you could simplify your website by reducing some content, making the design more emotional, or establishing a closer connection by asking your customers for feedback. Maybe you already have other great ideas of adding emotions to your financial product? Write them down! Another misconception of using UX is to generate killer features that will help to sell a product. For some companies, featuring is an obsession. The company believes that consumers measure the value of the product by how many features it has. A common way of thinking is to assume that the more features you deliver, the more likely customers will buy your product. This worked perfectly during the Marketing Age. If you came to a shop and compared two similar gadgets, and one had twice as many functions at the same price, then the choice was obvious. And it was not so important that only 20% of functions were ever used. We use this example in banking. At some banks, if you want to do an online payment, you have to click on “Payments, cards, accounts,” and it

This application remediates the website’s HTML, adapts Its functionality and behavior for screen-readers used by the blind users, and for keyboard functions used by individuals with motor impairments. If you’ve found a malfunction or have ideas for improvement, we’ll be happy to hear from you. You can reach out to the website’s operators by using the following email Our website implements the ARIA attributes (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) technique, alongside various different behavioral changes, to ensure blind users visiting with screen-readers are able to read, comprehend, and enjoy the website’s functions. As soon as a user with a screen-reader enters your site, they immediately receive a prompt to enter the Screen-Reader Profile so they can browse and operate your site effectively. Here’s how our website covers some of the most important screen-reader requirements, alongside console screenshots of code examples: Screen-reader optimization: we run a background process that learns the website’s components from top to bottom, to ensure ongoing compliance even when updating the website. In this process, we provide screen-readers with meaningful data using the ARIA set of attributes. For example, we provide accurate form labels; descriptions for actionable icons (social media icons, search icons, cart icons, etc.); validation
guidance for form inputs; element roles such as buttons, menus, modal dialogues (popups), and others. Additionally, the background process scans all of the website’s images and provides an accurate and meaningful image-object-recognition-based description as an ALT (alternate text) tag for images that are not described. It will also extract texts that are embedded within the image, using an OCR (optical character recognition) technology. To turn on screen-reader adjustments at any time, users need only to press the Alt+1 keyboard combination. Screen-reader users also get automatic announcements to turn the Screen-reader mode on as soon as they enter the website. These adjustments are compatible with all popular screen readers, including JAWS and NVDA. Keyboard navigation optimization: The background process also adjusts the website’s HTML, and adds various behaviors using JavaScript code to make the website operable by the keyboard. This includes the ability to navigate the website using the Tab and Shift+Tab keys, operate dropdowns with the arrow keys, close them with Esc, trigger buttons and links using the Enter key, navigate between radio and checkbox elements using the arrow keys, and fill them in with the Spacebar or Enter key.Additionally, keyboard users will find quick-navigation and content-skip menus, available at any

The background process also handles triggered popups by moving the keyboard focus towards them as soon as they appear, and not allow the focus drift outside of it. Users can also use shortcuts such as “M” (menus), “H” (headings), “F” (forms), “B” (buttons), and “G” (graphics) to jump to specific elements. We aim to support the widest array of browsers and assistive technologies as possible, so our users can choose the best fitting tools for them, with as few limitations as possible. Therefore, we have worked very hard to be able to support all major systems that comprise over 95% of the user market share including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox,
Apple Safari, Opera and Microsoft Edge, JAWS and NVDA (screen readers), both for Windows and for MAC users. Despite our very best efforts to allow anybody to adjust the website to their needs, there may still be pages or sections that are not fully accessible, are in the process of becoming accessible, or are lacking an adequate technological solution to make them accessible. Still, we are continually improving our accessibility, adding, updating and improving its options and features, and developing and adopting new technologies. All this is meant to reach the optimal level of accessibility, following technological advancements. For any assistance, please reach out to

write on a tablet is a drag! I read a post somewhere that tablets were for old people – sort of a transition tool to get them from laptops to phones. A number of my students do their entire posts on their phones. They’re way, way faster thumb typists than me! But I’m with you, laptops yes! Especially ultra-portables like your Macbook Air or my 12″ Macbook. Actually I just wrote about that recently: Yes, pretty interesting that we can try out laptops and tablets, but for apartments and homes we just sort of have to buy it and run with it! I’m not certain what the solution to your struggles with housing space during grad school might be, but I’m pretty sure the struggle itself is an important part of your research. Whether you have conversations with people about living spaces, or seek photographic language, or other modes, I think it’s a really rich space. For sure a lot of work has been done in the realm of dwellings, possessions, and so on, but I can’t think of anything coming at it in quite the way that you are – exciting! (even if also frustrating) At least when you
share a place with roommates you can always move out in a month or so if you have to. When peeps live with partners and then the relationship ends, that can really be painful. When the couple who live in the front house split up, she hid his juicer because she was pissed off at him. It cost $300. She gave it to me after he was gone. I didn’t really need it so it went to my mom’s garage sale where it went for $20. Oh! Amazing! I love the idea of putting up an Ikea bunk bed by the river and living outdoors with Nicole as part of your BFA thesis! I look forward to seeing pix and hearing reactions! I don’t remember if I told you when you visited the CSU Long Beach Art Galleries, but Chelsea McIntyre pitched a tent at a big tree near the galleries about 2 years ago. She lived in it for almost a week until someone from the university finally persuaded the head of the sculpture program to ask her to go home. I think her focus was a little different than yours, but for sure there’s some interesting overlaps. I’ll introduce

the 130 student F2F class that you met with. We use Slack for communication and discussion. It’s a great tool! The class is 100% online, but I’ve scheduled 4 optional meetups for the 1st 4 weeks so peeps who are available and interested can have a chance to meet each other and I can say hi. Tomorrow we’re off to the Seal Beach Pier to try some plaster casting. It’s a pretty fun and easy project. Except for that one time every 3 years or so that someone does it backwards and instead of pouring plaster in the sand mold they made of their hand or foot… they make a pool of plaster and hold their hands in it till it sets!! Probably the scariest thing that’s happened in the time I’ve been teaching! I was pretty sure we were headed for a hospital, but the student finally managed to wriggle her hands out of it. I have a big warning on the activity page, but occasionally somebody still gets it backwards. Photo by Tamara Williams Did you get a new charger for your poor Macbook yet? If you didn’t yet, be sure to check eBay before buying at the
Apple store. You might save some cash. Yes Marta! I’m with you. Trying to write on a tablet is a drag!

According to the ‘Global Top 100 Companies by market capitalisation’ study released by Big Four consultancy PwC, the world’s largest 100 companies have grown significantly since the

interests but also contributes to the healthy growth of the gaming industry in India. The gaming industry in India has been growing at a rapid pace in recent years. With the increasing penetration of smartphones and affordable data plans, more and more people are getting into gaming. However, this growth also brings with it the need for greater awareness about the importance of using legal and secure gaming sources. Teen Patti, in particular, has a special place in the Indian gaming landscape. It is a game that has been played for generations, both in traditional card - based formats and now in its digital avatars. The allure of winning in Teen Patti can sometimes make players overlook the risks associated with using unauthorized APKs. But it is essential to understand that a short - term gain (if any) from using such APKs can lead to long - term problems. For example, if a device gets infected with malware from an unauthorized APK, it can spread to other devices on the same network. This can affect not only the user's personal devices but also those of family members or colleagues. In a business or family setting, this can lead to a
loss of productivity, data breaches, or even financial losses. Furthermore, the use of unauthorized APKs can also have a negative impact on the reputation of the Indian gaming community. If the practice becomes widespread, it can give the impression that Indian gamers are not concerned about legality and security. This can deter international gaming companies from partnering with Indian developers or investing in the Indian gaming market. On the other hand, by promoting and using legitimate gaming platforms, Indian gamers can help create a positive image of the gaming community. This can attract more investment, leading to the development of better - quality games, more job opportunities in the gaming industry, and a more vibrant gaming ecosystem overall. In the age of digitalization, where information and entertainment are just a few taps away, it is crucial to make informed choices. When it comes to gaming, choosing the right platform is not just about having fun but also about protecting oneself and contributing to the growth of the industry. So, the next time you are tempted to download a "Teen Patti Winner" APK from an untrusted source, remember the risks involved. Think about the security of your device, your personal information, and

are essentially engaging in an illegal activity. Now, let's shift our focus to the security risks. These untrusted APKs are often a breeding ground for malware and viruses. Malware can infiltrate your device in various insidious ways. For instance, it can steal your personal information such as contact lists, banking details, and passwords. Imagine the havoc it can wreak if it gets access to your financial information. Viruses, on the other hand, can slow down your device, corrupt files, and even render it unusable. Another significant risk associated with these unauthorized APKs is their potential use for fraud or cheating in gaming. In the context of Teen Patti, which is a game of skill and chance, the integrity of the game is of utmost importance. If some players are using APKs that allow them to cheat, it not only ruins the experience for honest players but also undermines the fairness of the entire gaming ecosystem. For example, an unauthorized APK might give a player an unfair advantage by showing them the cards of other players or allowing them to manipulate the game results. In contrast, using legitimate gaming platforms available through official app stores like the Google Play Store or
Apple App Store offers several advantages. Firstly, these platforms have strict security measures in place. They vet every app that is listed on their store to ensure that it is free from malware and viruses. This means that when you download a game from these official sources, you can be relatively confident that your device's security will not be compromised. Secondly, official app stores ensure that the apps adhere to all relevant laws and regulations, including those related to intellectual property rights. This helps in maintaining a fair and legal gaming environment. For the game developers, it provides a legitimate avenue to distribute their creations and earn a rightful income. For the players, it guarantees that they are participating in a game that is being run fairly. Moreover, legitimate gaming platforms often offer additional features such as regular updates, customer support, and a community of players. Updates are crucial as they can fix bugs, improve gameplay, and enhance the overall user experience. Customer support is there to address any issues or concerns that players may have. And the community aspect allows players to interact with each other, share tips and strategies, and enhance the social aspect of gaming. In conclusion, it

Över hälften av konsumenterna använder nu digitala plånböcker för att handla online, och en nyligen genomförd studie visar att de blir ganska populära i Tyskland. Överraskande nog är det äldre generationer som går i bräschen på flera områden. babyboomers och seniorer är mer benägna än Generation Z-medlemmar att använda betalningsgateways av digitala plånböcker för e-handel. Ändå går möjligheterna med digitala plånböcker långt utöver enkla betalningar och överföringar. Mobiltelefonernas allestädes närvarande närvaro ger en speciell chans för dessa verktyg att bli en naturlig del av det dagliga livet. PYMNTS Intelligences forskning som gjorts i samarbete med Google Wallet klargör denna föränderliga terräng. Baserat på en undersökning av 2 302 tyska konsumenter som gjordes tidigare i år, erbjuder deras rapport ”Digital Wallets Beyond

Varierade acceptansnivåer för generationer med några överraskande trender. Enligt rapporten är den tyska marknaden redo för det kommande steget i utvecklingen av digitala plånböcker. Möjligheten till bred acceptans ökar i takt med att konsumenterna blir mer bekväma med att använda dessa verktyg för olika sysslor, från att visa ID:n till att komma åt evenemang. Den fullständiga forskningen ger grundlig information för en närmare undersökning av hur tyskar använder digitala plånböcker och vad framtiden kan föra med sig.

USB-C, and you know the charger you are using can deliver sufficient power to charge it, the weak link may well be the cable. Laptops that can charge via USB Power Delivery are becoming increasingly common, but few USB-C cables can match its top power requirements. Power Delivery previously maxxed out at 100W, with most cables that were said to be compatible able to handle 65W or 100W, but today it goes as far as 240W. Checking cable specs on product pages can be hit and miss, but at least with this new top-tier rating things should be about to get easier. The USB Implementers Forum group, which oversees the USB standard, has designed new logos to indicate whether a cable or charger can hit 240W, as illustrated below. We explain USB speeds, types and features in more detail in our separate guide; you might also like to read Thunderbolt 4 vs Thunderbolt 3 vs USB4. Plus, see our round-ups of the best USB-C Power Delivery chargers and laptop power banks. Marie has been writing about tech for 15 years.

to a maximum 480Mbps over the USB 2.0 standard. This Thunderbolt 3 cable from Plugable is the best all-rounder here when used with a compatible storage device or Windows or Mac PC or laptop. It offers the fastest data-transfer speeds, can carry enough charge to power any laptop, and it has an appealingly low price. When paired with a Thunderbolt 3 port you can expect theoretical data-transfer speeds of up to 40Gbps, which makes this cable well suited to carrying 4K+ video. You'll get lower bandwidth with a USB-C 3.1 port, but still up to 10Gbps. When it comes to charging, Plugable specifies Power Delivery support of up to 100W. Note that it does not support Qualcomm Quick Charge, however, so this cable may not be your best option for fast-charging a smartphone. As with many Thunderbolt 3 cables it is reasonably short, just 0.8m (2.6ft), which helps it to maintain performance. It also lacks the nylon braided housing of some of the more durable cables here, though it does come with a two-year warranty from the manufacturer. It's cheaper than Apple's Thunderbolt 3 cable, but should you be bothered by appearances know that it is available only in black.
Apple ships a 2m (6.6ft) USB-C 3.1 cable with all its MacBooks, but these Thunderbolt 3 cables are supported by the MacBook Pro and offer significantly faster charging and data transfer speeds. Thunderbolt 3 ports look the same as standard USB-C, but support data-transfer speeds up to 40Gbps. When this cable is instead used with a USB-C 3.1 port it is capable of data-transfer speeds of up to 10Gbps. It can also support Power Delivery at 100W. This is a short cable at just 0.8m (2.6ft), which is fairly standard for Thunderbolt 3. The faster speeds make this suitable for transferring 4K+ video. There's also support for DisplayPort High Bit Rate 3 (HBR3) video output. This 2m (6.6ft) cable is the same that ships in the box with Apple's MacBooks, though it also works with non-Apple products. It is of the quality you would expect from Apple, and slightly more durable than standard iPhone cables. Although Apple includes this cable with its MacBook Pro, it is not a Thunderbolt 3 cable. It can handle data transfer at 480Mbps rather than the 40Gbps a MacBook Pro can accommodate. Syncwire's nylon-braided USB-C to USB-A cable does pretty much exactly what it says on

This application remediates the website’s HTML, adapts Its functionality and behavior for screen-readers used by the blind users, and for keyboard functions used by individuals with motor impairments. If you’ve found a malfunction or have ideas for improvement, we’ll be happy to hear from you. You can reach out to the website’s operators by using the following email Our website implements the ARIA attributes (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) technique, alongside various different behavioral changes, to ensure blind users visiting with screen-readers are able to read, comprehend, and enjoy the website’s functions. As soon as a user with a screen-reader enters your site, they immediately receive a prompt to enter the Screen-Reader Profile so they can browse and operate your site effectively. Here’s how our website covers some of the most important screen-reader requirements, alongside console screenshots of code examples: Screen-reader optimization: we run a background process that learns the website’s components from top to bottom, to ensure ongoing compliance even when updating the website. In this process, we provide screen-readers with meaningful data using the ARIA set of attributes. For example, we provide accurate form labels; descriptions for actionable icons (social media icons, search icons, cart icons, etc.); validation
guidance for form inputs; element roles such as buttons, menus, modal dialogues (popups), and others. Additionally, the background process scans all the website’s images and provides an accurate and meaningful image-object-recognition-based description as an ALT (alternate text) tag for images that are not described. It will also extract texts that are embedded within the image, using an OCR (optical character recognition) technology. To turn on screen-reader adjustments at any time, users need only to press the Alt+1 keyboard combination. Screen-reader users also get automatic announcements to turn the Screen-reader mode on as soon as they enter the website. These adjustments are compatible with all popular screen readers, including JAWS and NVDA. Keyboard navigation optimization: The background process also adjusts the website’s HTML, and adds various behaviors using JavaScript code to make the website operable by the keyboard. This includes the ability to navigate the website using the Tab and Shift+Tab keys, operate dropdowns with the arrow keys, close them with Esc, trigger buttons and links using the Enter key, navigate between radio and checkbox elements using the arrow keys, and fill them in with the Spacebar or Enter key.Additionally, keyboard users will find quick-navigation and content-skip menus, available at any time

The background process also handles triggered popups by moving the keyboard focus towards them as soon as they appear, and not allow the focus drift outside it. Users can also use shortcuts such as “M” (menus), “H” (headings), “F” (forms), “B” (buttons), and “G” (graphics) to jump to specific elements. We aim to support the widest array of browsers and assistive technologies as possible, so our users can choose the best fitting tools for them, with as few limitations as possible. Therefore, we have worked very hard to be able to support all major systems that comprise over 95% of the user market share including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox,
Apple Safari, Opera and Microsoft Edge, JAWS and NVDA (screen readers). Despite our very best efforts to allow anybody to adjust the website to their needs. There may still be pages or sections that are not fully accessible, are in the process of becoming accessible, or are lacking an adequate technological solution to make them accessible. Still, we are continually improving our accessibility, adding, updating and improving its options and features, and developing and adopting new technologies. All this is meant to reach the optimal level of accessibility, following technological advancements. For any assistance, please reach out to

Great and sweet tastes, reasonable value, and strong throat hit made users satisfied with fruity and sweet flavors, whereas “strange” tastes made users dislike those flavors. Meanwhile, users complained about some e-liquids’ steep or expensive prices, bad quality, and harsh throat hit. There were 2342 fruity e-liquids and 2049 sweet e-liquids. There were 55.81% (1307/2342) and 59.83% (1226/2049) positive sentiments and 13.62% (319/2342) and 12.88% (264/2049) negative sentiments toward fruity e-liquids and sweet e-liquids, respectively. Great flavors and good vapors contributed to positive reviews of fruity and sweet products. However, bad tastes such as “sour” or “bitter” resulted in negative reviews. These findings can help businesses and policy makers to further improve product quality and formulate effective policy. Conclusions: This study provides an effective mechanism for analyzing users’ ENDS vaping experience based on sentiment opinion summarization techniques. Sentiment opinions on aspect and products can be found using our method, which is of great importance to monitor e-liquid products and improve work efficiency. The
market for electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) or electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) is growing rapidly. According to data from Research and Markets, the global electronic cigarette market was expected to grow at a compound annual rate of 16.6% during 2017-2022 and hit US $27.7 billion by 2022 [1]. E-cigarettes are now the most commonly used tobacco product among youth [2]. More than 2 million middle and high school students used e-cigarettes in 2016 [3]. Among middle school students, 31% use e-cigarettes because they contain multiple flavors [4]. To protect Americans from dangers of tobacco and nicotine, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) extended its authority to e-cigarettes in 2016 [5]. ENDS or e-cigarette products heat a liquid (e-liquid) that may contain nicotine, as well as varying compositions of flavorings, propylene glycol (PG), vegetable glycerin (VG), and other ingredients into an aerosol that the user inhales [3]. All elements in the e-liquid form the unique “vaping” experience. For example, VG produces more vapor than PG and offers a slight sweetness; PG provides more “throat hit” and usually carries a stronger flavor [6-9]. Mining vaping experience with e-liquid products can help FDA policy makers understand use patterns and reasons users like or dislike

could reveal more information and flavor patterns among users. Opinion summarization gave reasons users like or dislike flavors. For example, opinions such as “good/great juice” were usually adopted to express users’ positive sentiments toward e-liquids. Opinions such as “sweet/strong flavor” indicated that users liked fruity and sweet flavors because of sweet and strong tastes. The result was consistent with a previous study [35], indicating that candy-like flavors could increase the appeal to starters because they mask the heavy cigarette taste; furthermore, adding candy-like flavors could potentially be perceived as enjoyable. We found that good or great or nice juice and fruity or sweet flavor might make users dependent on or be addicted to the product. Words such as “adv (all day vape)” and “addicting/be addicted to” were used to describe these feelings. Among 8186 posts containing adjectives in the positive opinion summarization for fruity and sweet flavor, the number of posts containing “adv” and “addicting/be addicted to” were 1110 and 46, respectively. For example, some users expressed their feelings as follows: “This juice was absolutely delicious and a great adv;” “this is my adv (all day vape), i love the taste of the smooth caramel paired with the crisp green
apple flavor. Very addicting!!!!;” “Sweet flavor that is nice for an ADV;” “I am addicted to this juice.” Opinions such as “bad juice/terrible flavor/harsh throat hit” described why users disliked these flavors. E-cigarette flavorings could potentially be harmful to users. Prior research has found that the majority of users reported negative sentiments about symptoms. Negative symptom words included “dry,” “nausea,” “burn,” “hurt,” “sore,” “tingle,” “fatigue,” “sick,” “toothache,” “cough,” and “headache” [22,24]. Among 929 posts containing adjectives in the negative opinion summarization for fruity and sweet flavor, the number of posts containing negative symptoms was 38. For example, users described symptoms caused by flavors as follows: “I do get a headache from all the sweeteners if I vape too much too quickly;” “Lemon vapes give me a headache;” and “The harsh throat hit makes me cough.” Our research shows that both attractiveness and negative symptoms of fruity and sweet products had effects on users’ health. Policy makers need to pay more attention to these products and take appropriate regulatory action to reduce health risk. For example, they may formulate a comprehensive policy to manage ingredients, dosage, and sales of such products. The proposed method for analyzing vaping behavior also has the potential

the apple I want, like a crispy interior and a certain ratio of sweetness to tartness. If I share these attributes with my friend (in a way that is not too annoying, let’s hope), she is more likely to buy an apple that I enjoy. However, if I let her go to the store and bring back whatever she thinks is appropriate, it is hardly fair for me to get upset when she brings me an apple that I deem unworthy. After all, I never gave her useful information about what I wanted. Courtesy of Allison Shelley/The Verbatim Agency for American Education: Images of Teachers and Students in Action To extend this analogy to the classroom, teachers must share specific expectations for each assignment with students early and often. If not, we are asking them to hit invisible targets, which is unfair. When teachers make a habit of providing criteria for success with each assignment and responding to student work by sharing how the student met the listed criteria and what they still need to do, they provide objective feedback. If they make suggestions for where kids could improve, however, that moves away from feedback and into the realm of
guidance. Any subsequent grade is evaluative and is therefore also not classified as feedback. While guidance and evaluation have a place in student work, they lack the focused response of showing students the “why” behind their success (or lack thereof). Therefore, when teachers talk to students about giving them “feedback,” they should only be referring to student performance in relation to a specific set of criteria for success. If teachers use that same term to include guidance and evaluation, students will value the feedback process less because it will seem subjective and perhaps tinged with bias. Last week I attended a tap dance class. The teacher was performing any number of complicated steps, and I struggled to keep up. As I tried to listen to the sound my shoes were making in the cacophony of the class, I couldn’t help but wonder whether I was meeting an appropriate standard for the dance routine. Unfortunately, the instructor kept dancing throughout the hour and provided no feedback, and I went home feeling uncertain. When teachers spend so much time working on the finer points of instruction with kids, they may assume that students know more about what is expected of them on any

from a lack of transparency from teachers about what success looks like. For their part, teachers do not create these opaque conditions on purpose. Instead, the misunderstandings that arise from teacher-to-student feedback are the result of flawed assumptions about how well students comprehend what is expected of them. The result, as I point out in Writing Their Future Selves (W.W. Norton, 2023), is “a vicious cycle that perpetuates itself in classrooms as teachers wonder why students ignore feedback that could help them improve, while students do not truly understand how to interpret what teachers communicate” (p. 72). To repair this gap in communication that I refer to as the “feedback hole,” it’s crucial to increase both the awareness and effectiveness of the systems that impart clear messages to students about their success, particularly in the middle school years when students take any perceived criticisms especially to heart. As education researcher Grant Wiggins points out in “Seven Keys to Effective Feedback,” teachers conflate feedback and grades all too frequently. For feedback to be meaningful, it has to be objective and clearly connected to criteria for success that are written in student-friendly terms. Suppose I want a friend to pick up an
apple for me from the grocery store. I probably have a list of criteria that define the apple I want, like a crispy interior and a certain ratio of sweetness to tartness. If I share these attributes with my friend (in a way that is not too annoying, let’s hope), she is more likely to buy an apple that I enjoy. However, if I let her go to the store and bring back whatever she thinks is appropriate, it is hardly fair for me to get upset when she brings me an apple that I deem unworthy.

senses the presence of a person. Once engaged, the LED changes to green and then back to white. You can even programme it to have an animated welcome sequence. Several of the latest Skodas are available with an optional USB-C port in the overhead console above the rear-view mirror. It’s ideal for dashcams and sat navs, and eliminates the need for wires trailing from the windscreen to the centre console. Without wishing to state the obvious, what’s great about so many of these features is how simple and clever they are. Like the rubber lid for the washer fluid bottle, which turns into a funnel when opened, making it easier to top up the fluid. The Skoda umbrella dates back to the first Superb model of 1934. It returned to the reincarnated Superb in 2001, and has been providing shelter from the rain ever since. The water-resistant umbrella compartments are found in either the front doors or under the passenger seat. Still want that Rolls-Royce? We should point out that not all of these Simply Clever features are reserved for Skoda models. Others, like the ticket holder, can be found in rival cars. It’s just that Skoda has cornered the
market when it comes to practical solutions. The ticket holder clips to the side of the windscreen to provide a handy place for parking tickets and passes. Heck, you could even stick a photo of Vernon Kay in the holder. The new Skoda Octavia feels like a huge step forward for the popular hatchback and estate car. It’s bigger, safer and more efficient than its predecessor, and represents tremendous value for money. One of its Simply Clever features is an AdBlue filler tube which allows for refilling using a lorry pump. Ford owners will be screaming at their screens saying that they’ve been enjoying this benefit for years. Quite right, but this isn’t a list of Skoda innovations – it’s a run through of some of the best Simply Clever features. The plastics are spring-loaded, so they flip out to prevent scratches on your car and the vehicle parked next to you. Park next to a Ford Focus for a battle of door-edge protectors before dawn. This one is good. The cupholder in the centre console is designed to lock a bottle in place, so you can open or close it with one hand while driving. Keyless start is great, but

side is easily washable, while the other side is covered in textile carpeting. A removable torch is commonplace in a lot of new cars. In a Skoda, the LED torch features a magnet, so it can be attached to the car’s body. Alternatively, you could stick it to your fridge. ‘A flexible compartment in the boot will keep anything in place, even a ball – no matter how round or fidgety it is,’ says Skoda. Does that include a really small dog? Don’t try this at home. When you think about it, the underside of the parcel shelf is wasted space. It could be used for storing lightweight objects such as an umbrella or clothing. Possibly a large picture of Vernon Kay’s face, which will make people jump at the click and collect door. This is one to file under ‘first world problems’, but it can be difficult to locate the close button when you’re using an electric tailgate at night. With Skoda’s Tip-to-Close function, it can also be closed by lightly pulling on the tailgate. Simple. And clever. The little waste bin clips onto the side of the passenger door storage pocket. Skoda says it can be used for
apple cores, sweet wrappers and paper tissues. Other waste is available. It’s not a legal requirement within the UK, but a high-vis vest must be carried in many European countries. Skoda provides the holder, leaving you to provide the vest. Have you ever struggled to carry a giraffe sculpture home from an antique shop? Or maybe a pair of stilts? The backrest of the front passenger seat folds down for this very purpose. Make sure your passenger is happy to catch the bus. Hooks are great when you want to stop a shopping bag from toppling over on the way back from the shops. The top tether anchor points can be turned into a hook when the Isofix points aren’t required. The multifunction storage pocket underneath the load cover is ideal for coats, jackets and umbrellas. As also found in the Renault Clio Baccara. This one’s a bit niche, especially in the UK, but the removable ski bag protects your skis from being scratched. Or you could look really cool by putting the skis on the roof. Being able to fold the rear backrests from the boot is one of those features you’ll appreciate over time. It’s just… easier. As much

Articles As a Golf Fitness Specialist employed at a Country Club, I often train senior members(55+) who complain of lost distance and rising handicaps. Many in this age group believe if they can just gain a few more yards, it will help drive their handicaps back to where they once were. The reality is their declining score is often caused by more than just the
loss of distance. With the advent of TPI functional fitness screening, fitness trainers have a valuable tool to identify and correct many of the swing flaws plaguing the senior player. Most in this age group do not score particularly well in several of the TPI tests (particularly the deep squat and balance tests), and this is to be expected given the aging process. While remedial exercises are no doubt a critical part of the improvement process, it is often the lack of overall muscular strength and endurance that is the root cause of their declining game. For many who just play golf or walk to stay fit and do not regularly practice strength training, age related loss of muscle mass (sarcopenia) becomes a major culprit in the loss of flexibility and power. Along with declining aerobic capacity, it becomes difficult for many older players to finish a round without fatigue. It is often the last 4 or 5 holes where most strokes are lost as tired arms and legs trudge off the 18th green. In developing training activities for these players, I have found a general strength training routine, working all the major muscle groups (with considerable core exercises) along with

good for overall health improvement, weight loss for many can help improve overall swing mechanics and is clearly a significant factor to improve on course endurance. I am a big fan of a low refined sugar diet, and my “D’GOLF” diet plan has helped a number of clients achieve their weight goals without a lot of stress. You can visit my website (www.GOL-FIT.com) for more information. On course nutrition is a huge factor in making sure a player can finish a round with the proper energy and muscle control, at any age. Run out of muscle glycogen and your body starts recruiting other forms of energy, not to mention the risk of low blood sugar. Central nervous system response is critical to making sure muscle contractions occur properly and if your body lacks sufficient fuel or becomes dehydrated, the commands from your brain to your muscles are going to be interrupted and that means it’s more than likely players will be “leakin’ oil” on the back nine. I normally recommend a proper meal an hour or so before a round (a balance of 50% carbohydrates, 33% protein and 17% fat). After finishing nine holes, a snack of some nuts, an
apple, banana, or other low glycemic food is good to keep energy levels up and insulin levels down. Somewhere about the 16th hole it’s ok to have an energy bar with some sugar to provide a boost for the last few holes. However, I recommend testing this sequence as the “law of individual differences” applies. This strategy will likely work well for most, but others may need to adjust this formula to their individual metabolisms. The challenges facing the aging player are often formidable. For those willing to invest both the time and the energy to properly train, however, the payoff is not only significant in terms of their golf game, but results in the reduced risk of disease and frailty and is the gateway to a more vibrant and energetic life. Below are some of my favorite exercises that I use with many of my senior players but are effective for players of any age. Try incorporating these into your current exercise regimen.

present, these distros are adding in technology such as XGL, compiz, beryl etc. that really needs to be left out and tested more. These desktop effects are a disaster. And as this author notes, the average user does not give a damn about the reasons why or any excuses, they just expect things to work. Roll out Linux on a desktop PC for HP or Dell, and give people these results will lead to a complete disaster for Linux. But then again, I am in the minority who thinks that Linux should just drop this desktop crap all together and focus on it’s core where it has found success. As I write this I am conducting a server migration with Linux that I would NEVER be able to do, or at least to do as painlessly, with any Windows server. Different people have different standards. As a developer, I have very high demands for consistency, reliability, and maintainability. A novice might prefer simplicity and usability. Power users, it seems, like nice icons and smooth fonts. To each his own. The free software desktop will have an easier time appealing to the massive population of limited-needs users (including the corporate desktop
market) and the strategically important population of developers than it will have attracting (demanding and useless) power users. My definition of polish is that things work and work together as one would expect. I personally couldn’t care less if an icon isn’t as nice as it could be as long as it’s clear what the icon is supposed to represent. I know there’s a whole slew of people working on Tango, Oxygen, and other icon projects, and while I wouldn’t mind some more attractive icons, I think there’s way more important “polish” issues to be ironed out. I’d like these X resolution detection bugs to go away and never come back. I’ve been editing XF86Config and xorg.conf for ten years, and it’s just embarrassing that we can’t lick this one. Xorg 7.3 can’t come soon enough, and I hope it lives up to its expectations. From a desktop perspective, we’re currently in between the second and third generations of free software desktop technology. I switched to Linux as my predominant platform at the dawn of the second generation, characterized by the arrival of Mozilla and later OpenOffice. Many more with switch with the third generation, which will be characterized by modular

happen for some time if ever. Kernel development is pushing server more than desktop options so this is not a spupprise. It is to laugh. XP boots to a fully functioning GUI in 12 seconds? You must not be loading ANYTHING other than the OS, right? Add in Norton AV and a firewall and try again, dude. And “fully functioning GUI” – I’ve NEVER seen that in 12 seconds. I see a DESKTOP in maybe 20 seconds (my machine is NOT 3GHz) and then I see the disk churn for another 30 seconds at least before I can effectively use the machine. My Kubuntu 6.10 comes to a TRULY fully functioning GUI in much less time. well I am sorry for you. Using Norton.. make system partition sepatate and read only for user (and adjust registry as needed so software will run) Don’t use IE. Why would I need Norton firewall? there are better choices. Use OBSD as a firewall. Ubuntu fast boot.. compare “your kbuntu” (with upstart if you wish) to slack, gentoo or arch. Ubuntu is still woefully unpolished. It’s definitely an improvement over the last release, but Feisty still falls well short of a passing grade. Would
Apple ship an operating system where one menu has two mismatching “information” icons? (right-click the network icon in the system tray and you’ll see what I mean). Icons system-wide are a complete and utter muddle, and have been for far, far too long. “Desktop Effects” is embarrassingly broken and simply shouldn’t have been shipped. Turning them on shouldn’t result in black windows under any circumstances. My Samsung monitor’s 1440×900 resolution wasn’t detected out-of-the-box and I had to resort to manually editing xorg.conf to get it working correctly. The fonts in OpenOffice.org are rendered differently to the way they’re rendered by GTK+, and have been for two releases now. Does Ubuntu do a lot right? Yes. Do they do enough right? No. A lot of desktop-effects depend on the drivers. i.e. I have noticed that no Nvidia drivers (repo version or official nvidia version) work for my 7900GS, while they all worked for my 6800card. It’s indeed strange that (K)ubuntu is like the only distribution that doesn’t detect resolution automatically, even the new stable debian detects it. But well, that’s like the only flaw I could detect, don’t have the problem of inconsistent icons because I use Kubuntu which has different icon

for the release of her debut album this October, Sagiv’s journey from budding cellist to innovative composer-performer is turning heads in the industry. Sagiv’s journey in music kicked off at age eight when she first picked up a cello. While she’s been in the music game professionally since then, it wasn’t until a couple of years ago that she took the plunge into composing her own pieces. This bold move has paid off, landing her gigs at some pretty impressive venues – we’re talking Carnegie Hall, WQXR, and even the Amsterdam Cello Biennale Festival. But it wasn’t all smooth sailing. The real game-changer for Sagiv came during a tough personal moment. Sitting by her grandmother’s hospital bed, she penned “Shades of Mourning,” which is set to be her debut single dropping on July 26, 2024. This heart-wrenching experience became the spark for her upcoming album. Sagiv shared, “My debut album explores the many forms and shades of grief, from mourning loved ones to grieving friendships and ideas. Through my music, I aim to convey these complex emotions while also advocating for the importance of peace.” The album, slated for an October 2024 release, dives deep into the murky waters of
loss and grief. However, it’s not all somber reflection – Sagiv’s compositions offer a glimmer of hope, a musical light at the end of the tunnel. To build anticipation, she plans to release a single each month leading up to the album launch, giving listeners a taste of what’s to come. What sets Sagiv apart is her ability to bridge classical traditions and contemporary audiences. Her compositions weave together traditional elements with modern sensibilities, drawing from personal experiences and cultural heritage. This unique approach creates emotionally resonant pieces that speak to listeners across generations, positioning Sagiv as an emerging voice to watch in the contemporary music scene. Sagiv’s rise in the industry has been marked by significant milestones. Last year, she made her solo debut at Carnegie Hall, performing her original piece “Roots” – a powerful statement of her artistic vision. For those interested in following Sagiv, you can explore her official website and connect with her on Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, and Spotify. As “Shades of Mourning” nears release, anticipation builds for Sagiv’s deeply moving experience. Representing a new generation of classical musicians, her work showcases music’s power to process complex emotions and connect diverse audiences. Sagiv’s journey from young cellist

classical guitar study have given him the ability to articulate multiple voices simultaneously, creating rich textures that somehow make the electronic elements feel more organic, more human. When asked about the album’s challenging nature, Bonaccorso doesn’t apologize for its complexity. Instead, he offers this thoughtful observation: “My music is very experimental and avant-garde. Hence, it might be a little bit ‘hard’ to listen to, but I firmly believe everyone can understand the messages hidden between the notes.” There’s something refreshingly honest about that statement. Already, Bonaccorso is at work on his next album, though he remains characteristically tight-lipped about its direction. He does, however, light up when discussing potential future collaborations, particularly mentioning violinist Caroline Campbell as a dream collaborator. One gets the sense that for Bonaccorso, the creative journey is never-ending. At 33 minutes, “Plastic Triode” might not be a long album, but it’s certainly a dense one. It stands as a testament to how classical training can be transformed through modern experimental techniques without losing its soul. The album feels like a conversation between past and present, between tradition and innovation. For those intrigued enough to dive into the journey, his work can be found on Spotify and
Apple Music. Curious listeners can also explore more on his website, where both his musical compositions and published poetry offer additional insights into his creative mind. Love it or be puzzled by it, “Plastic Triode” is impossible to ignore. It’s a reminder that in an age of algorithmic playlists and formulaic productions, there are still artists out there willing to follow their own peculiar visions, wherever they might lead. Published on By Globe Music, an independent record label based in Dubai, is quietly reshaping the realm of background music. With a network of over 250 artists creating instrumental music, they’ve already garnered more than 20 million streams – a testament to their immensely growing influence. German-born founder Ben Breternitz launched the label after an eclectic career that included acting in German television and designing custom fashion pieces. Now based in Dubai since 2022, he spends his time between there, Bali, and Miami – a nomadic lifestyle (which you can follow on Instagram) that oddly mirrors his label’s global approach. “We create high-quality instrumental music for every situation,” says Breternitz, who seems genuinely excited when discussing the label’s mission. “Whether it’s smooth jazz for cafés or lofi beats for studying, we’re giving

This application remediates the website’s HTML, adapts Its functionality and behavior for screen-readers used by the blind users, and for keyboard functions used by individuals with motor impairments. If you’ve found a malfunction or have ideas for improvement, we’ll be happy to hear from you. You can reach out to the website’s operators by using the following email Our website implements the ARIA attributes (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) technique, alongside various different behavioral changes, to ensure blind users visiting with screen-readers are able to read, comprehend, and enjoy the website’s functions. As soon as a user with a screen-reader enters your site, they immediately receive a prompt to enter the Screen-Reader Profile so they can browse and operate your site effectively. Here’s how our website covers some of the most important screen-reader requirements, alongside console screenshots of code examples: Screen-reader optimization: we run a background process that learns the website’s components from top to bottom, to ensure ongoing compliance even when updating the website. In this process, we provide screen-readers with meaningful data using the ARIA set of attributes. For example, we provide accurate form labels; descriptions for actionable icons (social media icons, search icons, cart icons, etc.); validation
guidance for form inputs; element roles such as buttons, menus, modal dialogues (popups), and others. Additionally, the background process scans all of the website’s images and provides an accurate and meaningful image-object-recognition-based description as an ALT (alternate text) tag for images that are not described. It will also extract texts that are embedded within the image, using an OCR (optical character recognition) technology. To turn on screen-reader adjustments at any time, users need only to press the Alt+1 keyboard combination. Screen-reader users also get automatic announcements to turn the Screen-reader mode on as soon as they enter the website. These adjustments are compatible with all popular screen readers, including JAWS and NVDA. Keyboard navigation optimization: The background process also adjusts the website’s HTML, and adds various behaviors using JavaScript code to make the website operable by the keyboard. This includes the ability to navigate the website using the Tab and Shift+Tab keys, operate dropdowns with the arrow keys, close them with Esc, trigger buttons and links using the Enter key, navigate between radio and checkbox elements using the arrow keys, and fill them in with the Spacebar or Enter key.Additionally, keyboard users will find quick-navigation and content-skip menus, available at any

The background process also handles triggered popups by moving the keyboard focus towards them as soon as they appear, and not allow the focus drift outside of it. Users can also use shortcuts such as “M” (menus), “H” (headings), “F” (forms), “B” (buttons), and “G” (graphics) to jump to specific elements. We aim to support the widest array of browsers and assistive technologies as possible, so our users can choose the best fitting tools for them, with as few limitations as possible. Therefore, we have worked very hard to be able to support all major systems that comprise over 95% of the user market share including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox,
Apple Safari, Opera and Microsoft Edge, JAWS and NVDA (screen readers), both for Windows and for MAC users. Despite our very best efforts to allow anybody to adjust the website to their needs, there may still be pages or sections that are not fully accessible, are in the process of becoming accessible, or are lacking an adequate technological solution to make them accessible.

Apeaksoft iOS Unlocker is one of them. This innovative iPhone unlocker has a streamlined user interface that makes unlocking approachable and, at times, even enjoyable. All lock types can be unlocked, but sometimes, the process involves extra steps you need to complete manually to achieve the desired result. Pros: Cons: Best for: Those who don’t care about MDM unlocking Price: Free version available (the full version starts at $29.95 a month) EaseUS MobiUnlock surprises with its affordable lifetime license and an even more affordable monthly subscription plan, which can be used to unlock up to 5 devices. You can use the tool to remove all main types of iPhone/iPad/iPod passcodes, including 4- and 6-digit codes, Touch ID, and Face ID. Unfortunately, EaseUS MobiUnlock can’t remove the mobile device management (MDM) lock. If that’s the lock you need to remove to regain access to your iPhone, then this software won’t be able to help you at all. If you don’t care about MDM unlocking, then EaseUS MobiUnlock can be a solid choice. Pros: Cons: Best for: People who want to be certain that their device can be unlocked before purchase Price: Free version available (the full version starts at $29.95 per
quarter for the Windows version and $35.95 per quarter for the Mac version) Mobitrix LockAway is a capable unlocker developed by iOS jailbreak/cracking experts. The tool has earned many positive online reviews thanks to its honest approach and convenient online compatibility checker. Using this checker, you can determine if any particular lock preventing you from using your device can be unlocked. When we tested the online compatibility checker, we were informed that the screen passcode on our iPhone 13 could be unlocked in less than 30 minutes. The Apple ID unlock process would involve some extra steps, according to the checker, but that’s to be expected. Pros: Cons: Best for: Those who want to pay for just one unlock Price: Free version available (the full version starts at $19.95 per unlock) ApowerUnlock isn’t particularly praiseworthy when it comes to its unlocking capabilities because Apple ID unlocking is available only for iOS 11.3 and earlier. To unlock Apple ID on devices running iOS 11.4 or later, the Find My iPhone features must be turned off first. What makes this unlocker worthy of being included on our list is its customer-friendly pricing. Instead of offering multiple subscription plans and perhaps an expensive unlimited

Don’t lose hope if you’ve locked yourself out of your iPhone. The top 10 best iPhone unlockers recommended in this article can unlock it in no time—no special skills required. An iPhone passcode unlocker, or sometimes iPhone unlock software, is a software application whose purpose is to reset a locked iPhone to a factory state, removing the screen lock in the process. Once your iPhone is in its factory state, you can simply set a new passcode and activate the device using your
Apple ID and password. iPhone unlockers work by putting your device into recovery mode (a special mode for iOS troubleshooting) and performing an erase & restore. Technically, you don’t need iPhone unlocking software to erase an iPhone in recovery mode and set it up again, but the best iPhone unlockers make the process much easier. Note: No unlocker listed in this article can remove the Activation Lock on iPhones running the latest version of iOS. That’s because Activation Lock removal is possible only via jailbreaking, a risky process that can potentially brick your device, and there’s currently no way to jailbreak iOS 16 and newer. It can be surprisingly difficult to select an iPhone unlocker because there are many seemingly identical products competing for your attention and money. Here are the criteria we focused on when deciding which unlockers to recommend: Combined, the following iPhone unlock software tools for Mac and Windows can reliably unlock all iPhone models and versions of iOS currently supported by Apple, and some can handle even those that are not supported anymore. Note: The listed prices were valid at the time of publication but may have changed since then due to time-limited discounts and promotional offers.

At times, the cryptocurrency movement can feel like a ubiquitous and inevitable move toward the future of finance and technology. Its supporters are, to say the least, very supportive, and new headlines continue to appear on news feeds that show improving institutional, enterprise, and governmental interest in both digital tokens and its underlying technology, the blockchain. To be sure, all of these things are true. At this month’s Consensus conference in New York City, Steven Quirk, an executive vice president at TD Ameritrade, noted that the company has tens of thousands of people interested in crypto-related
financial products. Moreover, he commented attendance has been “off the charts” at the company’s Bitcoin training seminars. Meanwhile, the world’s fifth largest electrical company recently announced a partnership with an Ethereum-based dApp, iExec, for a project test. Perhaps most notably, Facebook, the most used social media platform in the world, is building its own cryptocurrency-based payment system that will utilize a Facebook initiated digital token. However, despite all this movement and an incredible amount of buzz, crypto adoption is frustratingly slow. In most countries, less than 10% of the population own Bitcoin or other digital currencies, and actual real-world experiences with digital currencies are similarly restrained. Of course, this disparity naturally begs the question: why is crypto adoption so slow? If the technology is so promising, the tokens so useful, and the digital ecosystem so ready, why aren’t more people using cryptocurrency. While there is no single answer, there are several factors that are contributing to crypto’s slow adoption at every level. It’s impossible to have a conversation about crypto adoption without including Bitcoin. The first and still most valuable digital token carries the most widespread brand recognition, and it dominates more than half of the crypto market. It’s also hilariously

pegged token, creating a market-based solution to the issue of volatility. Even as more products like this come to market, it can be challenging to overcome the dominant narrative that cryptocurrencies are too volatile for mainstream adoption. For instance, a 2018 survey by YouGov found that nearly 80% of Americans have heard of Bitcoin, but only less than 20% have heard of Ether or Litecoin, two other top digital currencies. At this point, the majority of people have heard of Bitcoin. However, brand awareness beyond that is significantly lacking. This is incredibly problematic for crypto adoption. Bitcoin alone can’t fulfill all of the possibility of the crypto movement. Instead, it’s up to the hundreds of other platforms to meet the diverse and divergent demands of the modern institutional, enterprise, and governmental use cases. In fact, Bitcoin might be better off as an ambassador for the technology, rather than its ultimate fulfillment. Therefore, until the broad crypto economy cames better brand awareness, adoption for things like decentralized gaming, dApps, and other initiatives will continue to be slow. The same can be said for digital and mobile payments. Buyers have demonstrated a continual willingness to innovate their payment methodologies as things like
Apple Pay, Venmo, and PayPal have quickly become normative. However, until more people become aware of the possibility, adoption will continue to lag behind optimism. Perhaps most obviously, nobody is going to go all-in on a technology that remains in regulatory limbo. Despite many of the obvious and inherent benefits of digital currencies that are perfectly timed for the digital age, broad adoption requires more people to experience the benefits themselves, something that is unlikely to happen when a shifting regulatory landscape could disrupt the process. It’s possible that some oversight might be coming sooner rather than later. The Financial Action Task Force is poised to offer global regulatory standards that could make meaningful progress toward establishing norms that can usher in higher levels of adoption. Like any new technology, adoption is slow while skepticism abounds, and cryptocurrencies are no different. In this regard, growth begets growth, and we are likely looking at a future that is, in part, defined by crypto’s role in the financial system. The extent of that role is still being determined, and too slowly at that. Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment. Δ Xank is the world’s

voľne dostupnom linuxovom jadre vo verzii 2.6. Právnici Googlu sa medzičasom postarali o ochranné známky a patenty. Už len samotná akvizícia firmy Android vyvolala v odbornej verejnosti rôzne špekulácie. V týchto rokoch bol totiž takisto oficiálne predstavený prvý iPhone od firmy Apple. „Šuškalo“ sa o tom, že na trh s mobilnými zariadeniami sa chystá aj Google. V súvislosti s Androidom je dôležitý takisto dátum 5. november 2007. V ten deň vzniklo konzorcium Open Handset Alliance, v ktorom sa okrem Googlu spojili firmy HTC, Intel, LG, Motorola, Nvidia, Qualcomm, Samsungu a ďalšie. Pri svojom vzniku konzorcium prvýkrát otvorene hovorilo o Androide. Zhruba rok pred uvedením verzie Android 1.0 už firmy zdôrazňovali, že systém nebude slúžiť len potrebám Googlu. Výsledkom je, že systém Android je dnes možné nájsť na nespočetnom množstve zariadení od rôznych výrobcov. Prvá verzia dnes najpopulárnejšieho mobilného operačného systému ponúkala len základné funkcie, nad ktorými sa dnes už ani nezamýšľame. Podporované bolo prehliadanie internetu, snímanie fotografií a videí pomocou fotoaparátu telefónu, vzdialená kontrola e-mailov, satelitná navigácia, prehrávanie médií, odosielanie a prijímanie SMS aj MMS správ, telefonovanie a dokonca tiež vytáčanie hlasom. Za zmienku ďalej stojí podpora technológií Wi-Fi a Bluetooth. Veľmi zaujímavou novinkou bola v tom čase aplikácia Android
Market, odkiaľ si používatelia mohli sťahovať a aktualizovať svoje aplikácie v telefóne. Ponuka aplikácií spočiatku nebola práve široká, vďaka voľne dostupným vývojárskym nástrojom si ale tvorcovia obsahu Android postupom času obľúbili.

Všetky takéto doplnené články označujeme. Tento týždeň sme si pripomenuli zaujímavú udalosť. Pred 16 rokmi (23. septembra 2008) bola svetu predstavená prvá komerčne dostupná verzia operačného systému Android. Niesla označenie Android 1.0 a na trh prišla na smartfóne HTC Dream, ktorý bol u nás známy pod názvom T-Mobile G1. Na našom webe dokonca dodnes nájdete dobový test tejto dvojice. A hoci verejnosť sa Androidu dočkala až vtedy, v skutočnosti mal systém pod patronátom Google za sebou už zaujímavú a pomerne dlhú históriu. Jeho vývoj totiž začal ešte v roku 2003 pod rovnomennou firmou. Pri jej založení stál okrem iných osobností aj Andy Rubin, často označovaný ako „otec Androidu“. O dva roky neskôr startup odkúpila firma Google, pod ktorej vedením Andy Rubin a jeho tím pokračovali vo vývoji. Svoj mobilný operačný systém napokon založili na voľne dostupnom linuxovom jadre vo verzii 2.6. Právnici Googlu sa medzičasom postarali o ochranné známky a patenty. Už len samotná akvizícia firmy Android vyvolala v odbornej verejnosti rôzne špekulácie. V týchto rokoch bol totiž takisto oficiálne predstavený prvý iPhone od firmy
Apple. „Šuškalo“ sa o tom, že na trh s mobilnými zariadeniami sa chystá aj Google. V súvislosti s Androidom je dôležitý takisto dátum 5. november 2007. V ten deň vzniklo konzorcium Open Handset Alliance, v ktorom sa okrem Googlu spojili firmy HTC, Intel, LG, Motorola, Nvidia, Qualcomm, Samsungu a ďalšie. Pri svojom vzniku konzorcium prvýkrát otvorene hovorilo o Androide. Zhruba rok pred uvedením verzie Android 1.0 už firmy zdôrazňovali, že systém nebude slúžiť len potrebám Googlu. Výsledkom je, že systém Android je dnes možné nájsť na nespočetnom množstve zariadení od rôznych výrobcov. Prvá verzia dnes najpopulárnejšieho mobilného operačného systému ponúkala len základné funkcie, nad ktorými sa dnes už ani nezamýšľame.
